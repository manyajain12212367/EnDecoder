 A Flask-based web application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using three different encryption methods: Caesar Cipher, AES, and RSA. This project demonstrates the basics of encryption and decryption and can be used as a educational tool.  Features  Encrypt and decrypt text using Caesar Cipher, AES, and RSA User-friendly interface for easy encryption and decryption Supports key generation for AES and RSA encryption methods Technologies Used  Flask for building the web application HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface Python for the encryption and decryption logic Getting Started  Clone the repository Run python app.py to start the Flask development server Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 Note  This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for encrypting sensitive data in production.
